This is a repository for a Systems Metabolism of Sepsis project led by Brooks Leitner in the Perry Laboratory of Yale University.

The code for analysis is in the form of Jupyter notebooks (written in Python and R), and is available for the human RNA seq analyses, mouse untargeted plasma metabolomics, cytokine analyses, and isotope tracing data in plasma and all 7 tissues

All data for each of these are also included.
